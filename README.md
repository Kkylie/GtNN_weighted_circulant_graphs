Two experiments for Graph neural networks and non-commuting operators on the weighted circulant graph model.

1. Stability experiment to show the tightness of stability bound and stability performance on stable GtNN. (Stability_of_nonexpansive_operator_tuple.ipynb)
2. Transferability experiment for sparse graph tuples to show that transferbility holds for sparse graph tuple. (Transferability_for_sparse_graph_tuple.ipynb)
